Some of the sources of datasets which it offered were more appropriate and credible in this regard including the CDC WONDER and NIDA. However, it failed in offering the real generic working dataset links since some of the examples were a dummy link or generalized example rather than they were the set of datasets download links. This left me having to go further down to obtain real data.\n",

It demonstrated regions of regular analysis pipelines such as data preparation and cleansing, data pattern analysis and display, and was even competent in c ) statistical analysis as well as predictive modeling. All these steps match what I required for my project.\n",

        "On an average, ChatGPT gave good conceptual suggestions and its guidance was helpful, however, lacked in offering a functional dataset link or the usability check of the sources made it a little more challenging for me. Subsequently, I may use it to improve the code some more, add particular datasets, or to apply different techniques for analysing and visualising the trends.\n"
